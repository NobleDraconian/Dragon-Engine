# About
Dragon Engine is a Lua framework designed for Roblox. It seamlessly bridges the server/client boundary, unifies modules to allow for easy code communication (this also helps to prevent [cyclic requiring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_dependency)), and implements a [microservice structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) in your game.

This framework was originally inspired by @Sleitnick's [Aero Game Framework](https://github.com/Sleitnick/AeroGameFramework).

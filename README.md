This framework is still a work in progress. I cannot guarantee its stability in stressful environments. Please be aware of this when utilizing it in your games.

This repository is updated quite frequently, and I may or may not introduce updates that are not backwards compatible.<br/>
Use at your own risk!

# About
Dragon Engine is a Lua framework designed specifically for Roblox. It seamlessly bridges the server/client boundary, unifies modules to allow for easy code communication (this also helps to prevent [cyclic requiring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_dependency)), and implements an MVC-like structure to your game.

This framework was originally inspired by @Sleitnick's [Aero Game Framework](https://github.com/Sleitnick/AeroGameFramework).
